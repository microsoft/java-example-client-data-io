## Tutorial: Authenticated Discrete Execution Data I/O


The following examples demonstrate data I/O on discrete executions of R scripts by [authenticated users](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/api-doc/guide/introduction.html#introusers) on [stateless projects](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/api-doc/guide/introduction.html#anonymousprojects) managed by DeployR.

## Tutorial: Summary

| Example Application | Example Data Input | Example Data Output |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| EncodedDataInBinaryFileOut | DeployR-encoded application data | Working directory binary file |
| ExternalDataInDataFileOut | Reference to external data source | Working directory data file |
| RepoFileInEncodedDataOut | Reference to repository-managed binary file | DeployR-encoded R object data |
| RepoFileInGraphicsPlotOut | Reference to repository-managed data file | Graphics device generated plot | 
| RepoFileInRepoFileOut | Reference to repository-managed file | Reference to repository-managed file |
| MultipleDataInMultipleDataOut | Multilple data inputs | Multiple data outputs |

The name of each example application indicates the data input and data output types used by the application. The following naming convention applies:

[`Data Input Type`]In[`Data Output Type`]Out

For example, the `EncodedDataInBinaryFileOut` example indicates that DeployR-encoded application data (`EncodedDataIn`) will be sent as a data input while a binary file from the R session working directory (`BinaryFileOut`) will be returned as a data output.

The set of data input and output types currently demonstrated by these examples are described as follows:

- `EncodedDataIn` represents DeployR-encoded application data sent as a data input.
- `RepoFileIn` represents a reference to a repository-managed file sent as a data input.
- `ExternalDataIn` represents DeployR-encoded references to external data sources sent as an input.
- `MultipleDataIn` represents multiple data inputs.
- `EncodedDataOut` represents DeployR-encoded R object data returned as a data output.
- `BinaryFileOut` represents a binary file from the working directory returned as a data output.
- `GraphicsPlotOut` represents a plot generated by the graphics device returned as a data output.
- `DataFileOut` represents a data file from the working directory returned as a data output.
- `MultipleDataOut` represents multiple data outputs.

## Tutorial: Running the Examples

Use the DeployR CLI to download and run the `java-example-client-data-io` examples.
